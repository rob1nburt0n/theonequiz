// In the file named AugmentedIIFE.js, augment FruitMaker with a function 
// named slices() that accepts two arguments: the name of the fruit, 
// and the number of slices to make. It should return an array containing the name 
// of the fruit duplicated how ever many slices was requested.

// For example: slices("apples", 2) should return ["apples", "apples"]
